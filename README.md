# This project will be a chance for me to flex my HTML chops.
# It's very basic for the time being however I intend to return to it at a later date to style it    with some simple CSS

# The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipe pages
# These three links will lead to pages with an image and an unordered list of ingredients 
# As well as an ordered list of steps to make each dish
